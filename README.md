# Generic ring buffer manager

Library provides generic FIFO ring buffer implementation.

## Features

- Written in ANSI C99, compatible with `size_t` type for size data types
- Platform independent
- FIFO (First In First Out) buffer implementation
- No dynamic allocation
- Fast read/write operations using memory copy functions
- Thread safe when used as pipe with single write and single read
- Interrupt safe when used as pipe with single write and single read
- Suitable for DMA transfers
- Supports data peek and data skip

## How it works

![Ring buffer use cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaJerle/ringbuff/master/docs/buff_empty.svg?sanitize=true)

Image shows different corner cases. As for the reference, `R` stands for ***R**ead pointer* and `W` stands for ***W**rite pointer*. Pointer are being used when *read* or *write* operations are used respectively. Numbers `0 - 7` represent `S = 8` byte long data array. **S** represents buffer size.
`R` and `W` pointers always point to *next read/write* operation. When `W == R`, buffer is considered empty. When `W == R - 1`, buffer is considered empty. Please note that `W == R - 1` is valid only if `W` and `R` overflow at buffer size.

- ***a***: Buffer is empty as `W == R` (`0 - 0`)
- ***b***: Buffer holds `W - R` (`4 - 0`) bytes as `W > R`
- ***c***: Buffer is full as `W == R - 1` (`7 = 0 - 1`, remember, numbers can hold `S` different values, from `0` to `S - 1`). Buffer has `W - R` bytes ready for read as `W > R`
* ***d***: Buffer hold `S - (R - W)` (`8 - (5 - 3)`) bytes as `R > W`
* ***e***: Buffer is full as `W == R - 1` (`4 = 5 - 1`) and holds `S - (R - W)` (`8 - (5 - 4)`) bytes

> Effective number of bytes to read/write from/to buffer is always `1` less than buffer size. In case of example, maximal number of bytes buffer can hold is `8 - 1 = 7`.

> Consider `W` and `R` pointers to overflow at buffer size (`S`). If `S = 4`, `W/R` values are: `0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`. Example: `3 + 2 = 1`. Example: `1 - 2 = 3`.
> If `S = 5`, `W/R` values can be: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...`. Example: `1 - 2 = 4`

### Linear block and data skipping

Instead of using read function and copying data from working buffer to application buffer, application may instead use original working buffer and only read the data. This feature is very useful when implementing Direct Memory Access (DMA) feature on microcontroller or any other platform as it allows data transfer with zero-copy between memories.

![Ring buffer use cases](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MaJerle/ringbuff/master/docs/buff_lin_skip.svg?sanitize=true)

Image is used together with bottom example.

```c
/* Declare buffer variables */
ringbuff_t buff;
uint8_t buff_data[8];

/* Initialize buffer, use buff_data as data array */
ringbuff_init(&buff, buff_data, sizeof(buff_data));

/* Use write, read operations, process data */
/* ... */

size_t len;
uint8_t* data;

/* IMAGE PART A */

/* At this stage, we have buffer as on image above */
/* R = 5, W = 4, buffer is full at this point */

/* Get length of linear memory at read pointer */
/* Function returns 3 as we can read 3 bytes from buffer in sequence */
if ((len = ringbuff_get_linear_block_length(&buff)) > 0) {
    /* Get pointer to first element in linear block at read address */
    /* Function returns &buff_data[5] */
    data = ringbuff_get_linear_block_address(&buff);

    /* Send data via DMA and wait to finish (for sake of example) */
    send_data(data, len);

    /* Now skip sent bytes from buffer = move read pointer */
    ringbuff_skip(&buff, len);

    /* Now R points to top of buffer, R = 0 */
    /* At this point, we are at image part B */
}

/* IMAGE PART B */

/* Get length of linear memory at read pointer */
/* Function returns 4 as we can read 4 bytes from buffer in sequence */
if ((len = ringbuff_get_linear_block_length(&buff)) > 0) {
    /* Get pointer to first element in linear block at read address */
    /* Function returns &buff_data[0] */
    data = ringbuff_get_linear_block_address(&buff);

    /* Send data via DMA and wait to finish (for sake of example) */
    send_data(data, len);

    /* Now skip sent bytes from buffer = move read pointer */
    ringbuff_skip(&buff, len);

    /* Now R points to 4, that is R = W and buffer is empty */
    /* At this point, we are at image part C */
}

/* IMAGE PART C */

/* Buffer is considered empty as R = W */
```

Code may be rewritten to something like this:

```c
/* Initialization part skipped */

/* Get length of linear memory at read pointer */
while ((len = ringbuff_get_linear_block_length(&buff)) > 0) {
    /* Get pointer to first element in linear block at read address */
    data = ringbuff_get_linear_block_address(&buff);

    /* If max length needs to be considered */
    /* simply decrease it and use smaller len on skip function */
    if (len > max_len) {
        len = max_len;
    }

    /* Send data via DMA and wait to finish (for sake of example) */
    send_data(data, len);

    /* Now skip sent bytes from buffer = move read pointer */
    ringbuff_skip(&buff, len);
}

```

Refer to DMA example below for more real-life use case.

## Examples

Few examples to show how to use the library

### Basic example

Example shows how to use basic buffer implementation for writing and reading data from buffer

```c
/* Buffer */
ringbuff_t buff;
uint8_t buff_data[8];

/* Working data */
uint8_t data[2];
size_t len;

/* Initialize buffer */
ringbuff_init(&buff, buff_data, sizeof(buff_data));

/* Write 4 bytes of data */
ringbuff_write(&buff, "0123", 4);

/* Try to fully read buffer */
/* len holds number of bytes read */
while ((len = ringbuff_read(&buff, data, sizeof(data)))) {
    printf("Read successful of %d bytes\r\n", (int)len);
}
```

### DMA usage on microcontroller

Simple example showing how to use buffer in conjunction with DMA hardware
to efficiently transfer data from buffer to DMA with *zero copy*.

```c
/* Buffer */
ringbuff_t buff;
uint8_t buff_data[8];

/* Working data */
size_t len;

void send_data(void);

int
main(void) {
    /* Initialize buffer */
    ringbuff_init(&buff, buff_data, sizeof(buff_data));

    /* Write 4 bytes of data */
    ringbuff_write(&buff, "0123", 4);

    /* Send data over DMA */
    send_data();

    while (1);
}

/* Send data over DMA */
void
send_data(void) {
    /* If len > 0, DMA transfer is on-going */
    if (len) {
        return;
    }

    /* Get maximal length of buffer to read data as linear memory */
    len = ringbuff_get_linear_block_length(&buff);
    if (len) {
        /* Get pointer to read memory */
        uint8_t* data = ringbuff_get_linear_block_address(&buff);

        /* Start DMA transfer */
        start_dma_transfer(data, len);
    }
}

/* Called on DMA transfer finish */
void
DMA_Interrupt_handler(void) {
    /* Transfer finished */
    if (len) {
        /* Now skip the data as they were successfully transferred over DMA */
        ringbuff_skip(&buff, len);

        /* Reset length = DMA is not active */
        len = 0;

        /* Try to send more */
        send_data();
    }
}

```
