# Generic ring buffer manager

Library provides generic FIFO ring buffer implementation.

## Features

- Written in ANSI C99, compatible with `size_t` type for size data types
- Platform independent
- FIFO (First In First Out) buffer implementation
- No dynamic allocation
- Fast read/write operations using memory copy functions
- Thread safe when used as pipe with single write and single read
- Interrupt safe when used as pipe with single write and single read
- Suitable for DMA transfers
- Supports data peek and data skip

</p>

Image shows different corner cases. As for the reference, `R` stands for ***R**ead pointer* and `W` stands for ***W**rite pointer*. Pointer are being used when *read* or *write* operations are used respectively. Numbers `0 - 7` represent `S = 8` byte long data array. **S** represents buffer size.
`R` and `W` pointers always point to *next read/write* operation. When `W == R`, buffer is considered empty. When `W == R - 1`, buffer is considered empty. Please note that `W == R - 1` is valid only if `W` and `R` overflows at buffer size.

- ***a***: Buffer is empty as `W == R` (`0 - 0`)
- ***b***: Buffer holds `W - R` (`4 - 0`) bytes as `W > R`
- ***c***: Buffer is full as `W == R - 1` (`7 = 0 - 1`, remember, numbers can hold `S` different values, from `0` to `S - 1`). Buffer has `W - R` bytes ready for read as `W > R`
* ***d***: Buffer hold `S - (R - W)` (`8 - (5 - 3)`) bytes as `R > W`
* ***e***: Buffer is full as `W == R - 1` (`4 = 5 - 1`) and holds `S - (R - W)` (`8 - (5 - 4)`) bytes

> Effective number of bytes to read/write from/to buffer is always `1` less than buffer size. In case of example, maximal number of bytes buffer can hold is `8 - 1 = 7`.

> Consider `W` and `R` pointers to overflow at buffer size (`S`). If `S = 4`, `W/R` values are: `0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...`. Example: `3 + 2 = 1`. Example: `1 - 2 = 3`.
> If `S = 5`, `W/R` values can be: `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...`. Example: `1 - 2 = 4`

## Examples

Few examples to show how to use the library

### Basic example

Example shows how to use basic buffer implementation for writing and reading data from buffer

```c
/* Buffer */
ringbuff_t buff;
uint8_t buff_data[8];

/* Working data */
uint8_t data[2];
size_t len;

/* Initialize buffer */
ringbuff_init(&buff, buff_data, sizeof(buff_data));

/* Write 4 bytes of data */
ringbuff_write(&buff, "0123", 4);

/* Try to fully read buffer */
/* len holds number of bytes read */
while ((len = ringbuff_read(&buff, data, sizeof(data)))) {
    printf("Read successful of %d bytes\r\n", (int)len);
}
```

### DMA usage on microcontroller

Simple example showing how to use buffer in conjunction with DMA hardware
to efficiently transfer data from buffer to DMA with *zero copy*.

```c
/* Buffer */
ringbuff_t buff;
uint8_t buff_data[8];

/* Working data */
size_t len;

void send_data(void);

int
main(void) {
    /* Initialize buffer */
    ringbuff_init(&buff, buff_data, sizeof(buff_data));

    /* Write 4 bytes of data */
    ringbuff_write(&buff, "0123", 4);

    /* Send data over DMA */
    send_data();

    while (1);
}

/* Send data over DMA */
void
send_data(void) {
    /* If len > 0, DMA transfer is on-going */
    if (len) {
        return;
    }

    /* Get maximal length of buffer to read data as linear memory */
    len = ringbuff_get_linear_block_length(&buff);
    if (len) {
        /* Get pointer to read memory */
        uint8_t* data = ringbuff_get_linear_block_address(&buff);

        /* Start DMA transfer */
        start_dma_transfer(data, len);
    }
}

/* Called on DMA transfer finish */
void
DMA_Interrupt_handler(void) {
    /* Transfer finished */
    if (len) {
        /* Now skip the data as they were successfully transferred over DMA */
        ringbuff_skip(&buff, len);

        /* Reset length = DMA is not active */
        len = 0;

        /* Try to send more */
        send_data();
    }
}

```
